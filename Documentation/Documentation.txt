Naming Conventions
Classes and Interfaces :
•	Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalised. Interfaces name should also be capitalised just like class names.
•	Use whole words and must avoid acronyms and abbreviations.
Methods :
•	Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase and with the first letter of each internal word capitalised.
Variables : Variable names should be short yet meaningful.
•	Should not start with underscore(‘_’) or dollar sign ‘$’ characters.
•	Should be mnemonic i.e, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use.
•	One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary variables.
•	Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
Constant variables:
•	Should be all uppercase with words separated by underscores (“_”).
•	There are various constants used in predefined classes like Float, Long, String etc.
Packages:
•	The prefix of a unique package name is always written in all-lowercase ASCII letters and should be one of the top-level domain names, like com, edu, gov, mil, net, org.
•	Subsequent components of the package name vary according to an organisation’s own internal naming conventions.

File name
The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains (of which there is exactly one), plus the .java extension

Whitespace characters
Aside from the line terminator sequence, the ASCII horizontal space character (0x20) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that: 
-	All other whitespace characters in string and character literals are escaped.
-	Tab characters are not used for indentation.
